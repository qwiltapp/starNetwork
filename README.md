# Star Network

## Introduction

> This is the Udacity project submission 'Build CryptoStar Dapp on Ethereum' by Sameer Dewan


## Installation

> This project utilizes create-react-app. To run the client, ``cd client``, run ``npm install`` and then ``npm start``. To test the contract code, in the main directory run ``truffle develop`` and then in the truffle console, run ``test``.

## Features

> This project will allow you to search for a star by name and id. From the user interface, you will be able to search for a star and if it is not yet claimed, claim it. You can exchange your stars with others who have put up their own stars for barter, or buy them at the asked price. You can also transfer a star to another address. It is important to note that if you buy a star, you must spend the value asked + a bit extra for the contract to acknowedge the request. You will be refunded the difference. Gas costs vary, so if your transaction does not go through, a best course of action is to increment your gas expenditure. These options are left to the user in the interface to make their best judgement calls and experiment with what the Rinkeby network will acknowledge.
